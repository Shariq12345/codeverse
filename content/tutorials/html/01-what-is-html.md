# What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page using markup tags.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML elements are represented by tags, and browsers use these tags to render content.

## Key Features of HTML

- **Structure**: Defines the skeleton of web pages
- **Semantic**: Provides meaning to content
- **Universal**: Works across all browsers and devices
- **Easy to Learn**: Simple syntax and concepts

## Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML document follows a basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## HTML Tags Syntax

HTML uses tags to mark up content. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets:

```html
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
```

## Try It Yourself

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Try creating your first HTML page with a heading and paragraph!
